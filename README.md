# Project-Zero-The Sandwich


### The Sandwich

The Sandwich is a classic game based of the Tamagotchi digital pet game. The goal of the game is to keep your Sandwich fed, cold, and sliced by clicking buttons before your Sandwich grows mold. I used various types of sandwiches to represent your pet to show the process of aging your Sandwich. You can win this game by keeping your Sandwich alive until it reaches its full maturity as a dagwood sandwich. 

I used HTML, CCS, JavaScript, and jQuery to build the The Sandwich game. I had a lot of successes and failures with this project. I also had a lot of ideas to expand the site, which I did not get to imploy, but I plan to  continue working on this game. 

I have many unsolved problems based around building different levels with varying degrees of difficulty. I would like to continue to exlore solutions, so that when the Sandwich ages, it gets harder to meet its "needs". I also could not get the normalize.css file to link and had many issues with deployment.
